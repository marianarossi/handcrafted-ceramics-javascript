Hello!

This is my first project using Javascript. I developed a e-commerce website for handcrafted ceramics. 
I developed it using MDB Bootstrap, a front-end framework. Although I also tested my raw HTML/CSS knowledge developing the Product.html page.
It uses no back-end framework. The components are loaded dinamically from a JSON file.
